Coaching example illustrating cohesion with PHP and FizzBuzz

This is another contrived example of FizzBuzz, but I use it to illustrate several things:

1. Interfaces in PHP
2. Simple Factory pattern
3. Polymorphic dispatch (Formatter, Matcher)
4. "Extract 'till you drop" (HT: Robert C. Martin) taken to the extreme in FizzBuzz
5. Separating implementation from UI
